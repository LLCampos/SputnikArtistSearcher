# SputnikArtistSearcher

Currently, the way I use to get to know new musical artists is going to music social networks, find users that seem to have a similar musical taste to mine and checking the artists to which they gave higher ratings. The process sometimes is repetitive and frustrating, like when I have to look for artists I don't know in the middle of a list artists that I already know. Another problem is having to constantly check if the artist/music group plays music of a genre that I don't like to listen to.

So I developed this application to automate most of the boring parts of the process and make the discovery of new music more fun to me. The website I use in this app to discover new music is [SputnikMusic](http://sputnikmusic.com/).

This really is not supposed to be used by people other than me, because it is adapted to my ways and quirks. (It even has a connection with other app I developed). But feel free to adapt or use whatever you want.

I built this app in Java to show off and train my newly acquired Java skills. :)

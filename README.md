# SputnikArtistSearcher

Currently, the way I use to get to know new musical artists is going to music social networks, find users that seem to have a similar musical taste to mine and check the artists to which they give higher ratings. The process sometimes is repetitive and frustating, like when I have to look for artists I don't know in the middle of a list artists that I already know. There's also the problem that I have to constantly check if the artist/music group play musci of a genre that I don't like to listen to.

So I developed this application to automate most of the boring parts of the process and make the discovery of new music more fun to me. The website I use in this app to discover new music is ![Sputnikmusic] (http://sputnikmusic.com/).

This is really not supposed to be used by people other than me, because is really adapted to the way I do thing and to my quirks. (It even has a connection with other app I developed). But feel free to adapt or use whatever you want.

I build this app in Java to show off and train my newly adquired Java skills. :)
